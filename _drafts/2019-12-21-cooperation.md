I tend to spend my time thinking about cooperation -- how can we successfully work together? Why do I think about this so much? Well, the simple answer is that we're stronger together. There's a lot of stuff to get done, and we're more likely to actually succeed at it working together than apart.

Another way of putting it is that the whole "I, Pencil" essay, where all of humanity comes together to build something greater than the sum of its parts...that's pretty romantic, and I'm a sucker for romance.

Another reason why cooperation matters -- we've got one planet, and we have to share it. Failure to do so means death, literally. Climate change is the largest commons tragedy (read: cooperation failure) we've ever faced. And even if we get past that, we're still going to have to cooperate on nuclear weapons, AI risk, synthetic biology, cybersecurity, and more. Lack of cooperation is an _existential risk_. 

## A brief history of Western political economy
First, Thomas Hobbes comes out swinging by asserting that, left to their own devices, people are literally incapable of not killing each other and that without government, we're all doomed to a life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". Yikes. I imagine Hobbes probably didn't have the greatest time on the playground as a child. Anyway, Hobbes uses this idea to justify his claim that we should all surrender power to a central authority: The Leviathan.

Adam Smith comes in and says: "Holup. ____". Contrary to popular opinion on the left, Smith's Capitalism worked really well, directly leading to the largest reduction in poverty in the history of the world. Contrary to popular opinion on the right, there are tons of problems with Capitalism, and left unchecked, it would probably end up killing us all (link to meditations on moloch). 

Marx _____. Except Marx, having never read this blog or any of the resources linked in the sidebar, fails to understand just how difficult cooperation can be, and instead imagines the proletariat will somehow insta-coordinate with perfect information, magically avoding all the game theoretic traps that normal governments fall into. Hence why after the revolution, Communist states tended to not go as planned.

Then, in XXXX, Elinor Ostrom shocks the economics world by telling them what everyone else already knew: local communities  do not always destroy common resources and in fact govern themselves quite effectively through a myriad of evolved local mechanisms. What did these often rely upon? Social norms! And why might we have social norms in the first place? Group selection theory! What now, Hobbes?!

So, where does that all leave us? Our pre-eminent theories of political economy (or of cooperation?) have holes in them. They work, except for when they don't. Capitalism has succeeded in bringing billions out of poverty, but capitalists still can't justify original land ownership. After centuries of state interference, we've learned that maybe, just maybe, local communities can effectively govern themselves, which really is great


Why does all this matter? Re-read the above -- our political theories are incomplete!   


At the end of the day, failure to cooperate on the prisoner's dilemma means you and all your loved ones die. 

For starters, we're all still here. People learn about the PD, and then 

The standard economic theory of climate change is that we die. Seriously, it's pretty simple -- standard theory says that we all defect on a commons tragedy, and defection of the whole world on climate change leads to pretty morbid outcomes. Here's the catch: Standard 

Standard economic theory says that humans are cold, heartless monsters who will screw each other over every chance we get. And while that's not completely wrong, _it's also not completely right_. 


How to cooperate, and if we can at all, is one of the central questions in all of political science and economics. It's the best argument for why government should exist in the first place (governments solve prisoner's dilemmas, making everyone better off), and it's one of the best arguments against governments existing at all (people actually effectively solve prisoners dilemmas on their own, objugating (?) the need for governments at all)

Notes: Scaling up cooperation on the prisoner's dilemma to all of humanity is the central problem of my life!!! And this blog -- it should be how I tie everything together. TLDR is that we cooperate on small scale PDs even though standard theory says we shouldn't be able to, which means that standard theory is wrong, which means we could theoretically cooperate on large scale PDs. How do we scale cooperation?
